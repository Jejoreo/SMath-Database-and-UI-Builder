## About:
This steel database interface would be really useful if you happens to be using a book called "Tabel Profil Konstruksi Baja" by Ir.Rudy Gunawan. The aim of this program is to demostrate  the making of a  specifically targetted UI for civil engineers to input steel parameters. As a bonus,  I would also provide a .pdf instruction on how to load the created database in SMath studio. 

## Adjustment
The first one that'll you'll need to adjust is the location of the index image. You could replace them if you need to (I only make some rough sketches in Revu).  You should also adjust the widgets' sizes and pads. I didn't make it to a full dynamic type app since this one is a side project.
